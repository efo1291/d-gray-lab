# d-gray-lab
This is the skeleton for my docker based Graylog lab (Multiple Nodes)

If you just clone this repo and hit `docker-compose up` on your local computer 
you can (after some time) reach [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
that provides you some additional information where it reach what.

This will need minimal 4 GB RAM for Docker (check that before) as this will
start 2 Graylog Nodes and 2 Elasticsearch Nodes, 1 MongoDB and some additional
helper container.

Comments, issues and pull request are welcome.

# last words

This is my private lab that I use to test and verify issues from Customers. This
is not an official Graylog product and all support and assistance is privat
spare time.
